$Y**GENERAL**$W

$MStatement structure$W

  RP language is very small and limited.
  The syntax consist of two types of
  statements: assignment statements, and
  command statements.

  Assignment statement takes in variablename
  and adds value to it. There are multiple
  different types of assignment operators
  avaliable. 

  There can be two types of commands for
  command statements: CustomCommands, and 
  ConsoleCommands. The difference between the
  two is that different scenes might contain
  different set of custom commands, while
  every scene has the same console commands
  avaliable.

  Statements are ended by giving semicolon.
  If your program consists about only one
  statement, it can be left out, and might
  made the program run little bit faster.

$MCommand, and variable names$W

  Command, and variable names are case
  insensitive, so by writing "out",
  "OuT", and "OUT" will all call the
  same command. Everytime you write variable
  name, or command call the tokenizer
  switches the lower case characters to upper
  case characters.

$MComments$W

  Comments can be added to the code by adding
  question mark to it. Everything after 
  question mark is discarded by tokenizer
  until a new line, expect when tokenizer
  detects other question mark. This way, you
  can add comments between parts of code in
  one line.
