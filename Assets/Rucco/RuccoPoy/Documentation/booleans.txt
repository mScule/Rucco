$Y**Booleans**$W

You can use booleans in RP in expressions.
You can't have actual variable being type of
boolean, but you can contain string containing
boolean statement, that you can evaluate with 
run command when you want.

The syntax of booleans is almost identical with
most c type languages, but you can't use
parentheses to have higher order boolean checks.
