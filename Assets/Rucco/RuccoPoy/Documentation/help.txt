Rucco (Runtime Cheating COnsole) is a cheat
console, that uses RuccoPoy interpreter as
it's user interface. Rucco can be used
by writing the commands straight into the
console, or by running a script file with 
$Mlibrary$W command. RuccoPoy is a small
interpreted language that was designed for
this purpose. You can get to know the syntax
of RP more in depth by reading through the 
rest of the documentation. Here is the
commands that prints the documentation in 
recommended order:

    Goes through the basic syntax structure
    of Poy.
