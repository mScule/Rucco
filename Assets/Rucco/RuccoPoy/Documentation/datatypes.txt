$Y**DATATYPES**$W

$MFloat$W
  
  Every number is treated as a float number.
  Float works by parsing string of text to 
  C# float and treating it as such.

$MString$W

  String can contain anything. String literals
  can be defined by surrounding the string with 
  quotation marks '...', " ... " or curly braces 
  { ... }. By using curly braces you dont have 
  to escape quotes inside strings, and by using
  quotation marks, you don't have to escape closing
  curly brace.

  Datatype string can be code, array, numbers, and
  plain text. It's up to the operators, and commands
  to decide what to do with it.

$MEscape characters$W

  Inside string literal, you can use $M\n$W, $M\t$W,
  $M\\$W, $M\}$W, and $M\"$W to use escape characters.
  $M\}$W and $M\"$W are special cases. You use $M\}$W if
  string is contained inside curly braces,
  and $M\"$W if string is contained inside
  quotation marks. If you add $M\}$W inside 
  string that is contained inside "", it will
  cause a unsupported escape character error
  and vice versa inside {} using $M\"$W will
  cause the same.
