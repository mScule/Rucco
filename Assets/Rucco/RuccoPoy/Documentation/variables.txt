$MDeclaration$W

  Variables are declared by using hash sign
  '#' to tell the tokenizer to create
  variable name token. You need to assign a
  value of some sort to the value when
  creating the variable for the first time.
  If value is number, variable will be set to
  be a float, else it will become a string.

$MVariableName$W

  Variable name can start with letter, or
  underscore, but not number. Variable can
  contain numbers after the first letter.

$MScope$W

  RP has scopes avaliable in form of certain
  commands.

$MSwitching variable type$W

  If you want to change the current variable
  type, from float to string, you add part of
  string to it with string operations '&=' 
  (append string) or inside expression with 
  '&'. If you want to change variable from
  string to float, you need to assign a float
  value to it.
